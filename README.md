# Creating-Pixelated-Characters-Using-GAN

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/cryptopunks Kaggle. 

Image generation is a process of learning features from the given training data and
creating new samples with the similar features. In this article, we utilize Generative
adversarial network (GAN) to generate new non fungible token pixelated characters.
We then modified the existing network to a conditional GAN so that the features of
the outputs can be controllable. After training, the proposed network can generate
character images that have the features of an input label type.
